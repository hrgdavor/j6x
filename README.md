# j6sx

JavaScript UI library. Focused on ES6 and JSX
 - templates strictly JSX 
 - compatibility with older ES is low priority
 - will not compromise simplicity or ease of use to cater to older browsers
 - not guaranteed, but should work with older ES by using babel to tranform to compatible code
 - being turbo oriented to ES6 just for the sake of it, is also not a goal
